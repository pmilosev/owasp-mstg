## Testing Anti-Reversing Defenses on iOS

### Testing Jailbreak Detection

#### Overview

In the context of reverse engineering defense, jailbreak detection mechansism are added to make it a bit more difficult to run the app on a jailbroken device, which in turn impedes some tools and techniques reverse engineers like to use. As is the case with most other defenses, jailbreak detection is not a very effective defense on its own, but having some checks sprinkled throughout the app can improve the effectiveness of the overall anti-tampering scheme. Typical jailbreak detection techniques on iOS include:

##### File-based Checks

Checking for the existence of files and directories typically associated with jailbreaks, such as:

~~~
/Applications/Cydia.app
/Applications/FakeCarrier.app
/Applications/Icy.app
/Applications/IntelliScreen.app
/Applications/MxTube.app
/Applications/RockApp.app
/Applications/SBSettings.app
/Applications/WinterBoard.app
/Applications/blackra1n.app
/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/LiveClock.plist
/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/Veency.plist
/Library/MobileSubstrate/MobileSubstrate.dylib
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.ikey.bbot.plist
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.saurik.Cydia.Startup.plist
/bin/bash
/bin/sh
/etc/apt
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
/private/var/lib/apt
/private/var/lib/cydia
/private/var/mobile/Library/SBSettings/Themes
/private/var/stash
/private/var/tmp/cydia.log
/usr/bin/sshd
/usr/libexec/sftp-server
/usr/libexec/ssh-keysign
/usr/sbin/sshd
/var/cache/apt
/var/lib/apt
/var/lib/cydia
/var/log/syslog
/var/tmp/cydia.log
~~~

##### Checking File Permissions

Attempting to write a file to the /private/ directory. This should only be successful on jailbroken devices.

~~~

NSError *error;
NSString *stringToBeWritten = @"This is a test.";
[stringToBeWritten writeToFile:@"/private/jailbreak.txt" atomically:YES
         encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&error];
if(error==nil){
   //Device is jailbroken
   return YES;
 } else {
   //Device is not jailbroken
   [[NSFileManager defaultManager] removeItemAtPath:@"/private/jailbreak.txt" error:nil];
 }

~~~

##### Checking Protocol Handlers

Attempting to open a Cydia URL. The Cydia app store, which is installed by default by practically every jailbreaking tool, installs the cydia:// protocol handler. 

~~~
if([[UIApplication sharedApplication] canOpenURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"cydia://package/com.example.package"]]){
~~~

##### Calling System APIs 

-- TODO [Fork-based check] --

Executing privileged actions. Calling the system() function with a NULL argument on a non jailbroken device will return ”0”; doing the same on a jailbroken device will return ”1”. This is since the function will check whether /bin/sh can be accessed, and this is only the case on jailbroken devices. Another possibility would be trying to write into a location outside the application’s sandbox. This can be done by having the application attempt to create a file in, for example, the /private directory. If the file is successfully created, it means the device is jailbroken.'

#### Bypassing Jailbreak Detection

Once you start the application, which has jailbreak detection enabled on a jailbroken device, you will notice one of the following:

1. The application closes immediately without any notification
2. There is a popup window indicating that the application won't run on a jailbroken device

In the first case, it's worth checking if the application is fully functional on non-jailbroken device. It might be that the application is in reality crashing or has a bug that causes exiting. This might happen when you're testing a preproduction version of the application.

Let's look on how to bypass jailbreak detection using once again Damn Vulnerable iOS application as an example. 
After loading the binary into Hopper, you need to wait until the application is fully disassembled (look at the top bar). Then we can look for 'jail' string in the search box. We see two different classes, which are `SFAntiPiracy` and `JailbreakDetectionVC`.
You might also want to decompile the functions to see what they are doing and especially what do they return.

![Disassembling with Hopper](Images/Chapters/0x06b/HopperDisassembling.png "Disassembling with Hopper")
![Decompiling with Hopper](Images/Chapters/0x06b/HopperDecompile.png "Decompiling with Hopper")

As you can see, there is a class method `+[SFAntiPiracy isTheDeviceJailbroken]` and instance method `-[JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken]`. The main difference for us is that we can inject cycript and call class method directly, whereas when it comes to instance method, we must first look for instances of target class. The function `choose` will look for the memory heap for known signature of a given class and return an array of instances that were found. It's important to put an application into a desired state, so that the class is indeed instantiated. 

Let's inject cycript into our process (look for your PID with `top`):

```
iOS8-jailbreak:~ root# cycript -p 12345
cy# [SFAntiPiracy isTheDeviceJailbroken]
true
```

As you can see our class method was called directly and returned true. Now, let's call `-[JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken]` instance method. First, we have to call `choose` function to look for instances of `JailbreakDetectionVC` class. 

```
cy# a=choose(JailbreakDetectionVC)
[]
```

Ooops! The returned array is empty. It means that there are no instances of this class registed within the runtime. In fact, we haven't clicked second 'Jailbreak Test' button, which indeed initializes this class:

```
cy# a=choose(JailbreakDetectionVC)
[#"<JailbreakDetectionVC: 0x14ee15620>"]
cy# [a[0] isJailbroken]
True
```

![The device is jailbroken](Images/Chapters/0x06j/deviceISjailbroken.png "The device is jailbroken")

Hence you now understand why it's important to have your application in a desired state. 
Now bypassing jailbreak detection in this case with cycript is trivial. We can see that the function returns Boolean and we just need to replace the return value. We can do it by replacing function implementation with cycript. Please note that this will actually replace function under given name, so beware of side effects in case if the function modifies anything in the application:

```
cy# JailbreakDetectionVC.prototype.isJailbroken=function(){return false}
cy# [a[0] isJailbroken]
false
```

![The device is NOT jailbroken](Images/Chapters/0x06j/deviceisNOTjailbroken.png "The device is NOT jailbroken")
In this case we have bypassed Jailbreak detection of the application!

Now, imagine that the application is closing immediately upon detecting that the device is jailbroken. In this case you have no chance (time) to launch cycript and replace function implementation. Instead, you would have to use CydiaSubstrate, use proper hooking function, like `MSHookMessageEx` and compile the tweak. There are good sources on how to perform this [15-16], however, we will provide possibly faster and more flexible approach.

**Frida** is a dynamic instrumentation framework, which allows you to use among other a JavaScript API to instrument the apps. One feature that we will use in bypassing jailbreak detection is to perform so-called early instrumentation, i.e. replace function implementation on startup.

1. First, ensure that `frida-server` is running on your iDevice
2. iDevice must be connected via USB cable
3. Use `frida-trace` on your workstation:

```
$ frida-trace -U -f /Applications/DamnVulnerableIOSApp.app/DamnVulnerableIOSApp  -m "-[JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken]"
```

This will actually start DamnVulnerableIOSApp, trace calls to `-[JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken]` and create JS hook with `onEnter` and `onLeave` callback functions. Now it's trivial to replace return value with `value.replace()` as shown in the example below:

```
    onLeave: function (log, retval, state) {
    console.log("Function [JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken] originally returned:"+ retval);
    retval.replace(0);  
      console.log("Changing the return value to:"+retval);
    }
```

Running this will have the following result:

```
$ frida-trace -U -f /Applications/DamnVulnerableIOSApp.app/DamnVulnerableIOSApp  -m "-[JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken]:"

Instrumenting functions...                                           `...
-[JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken]: Loaded handler at "./__handlers__/__JailbreakDetectionVC_isJailbroken_.js"
Started tracing 1 function. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

Function [JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken] originally returned:0x1
Changing the return value to:0x0
 22475 ms  -[JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken]
 ```
 
Please note that there were two calls to `-[JailbreakDetectionVC isJailbroken]`, which corresponds to two physical taps on the app GUI.
 
Frida is a very powerful and versatile tool. Refer to the documentation [3] to get more details.

### Testing Anti-Debugging

#### Overview

Debugging is a highly effective way of analyzing the runtime behaviour of an app. It allows the reverse engineer to step through the code, stop execution of the app at arbitrary point, inspect and modify the state of variables, and a lot more.

The app should either actively prevent debuggers from attaching, or terminate when a debugger is detected.

#### White-box Testing

-- TODO [Describe how to assess this with access to the source code and build configuration] --

#### Black-box Testing

-- TODO [Needs more detail] --

Attach a debugger to the running process. This  should either fail, or the app should terminate or misbehave when the debugger has been detected. For example, if ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH) has been called, gdb will crash with a segmentation fault:

Note that some anti-debugging implementations respond in a stealthy way so that changes in behaviour are not immediately apparent. For example, a soft token app might not visibly respond when a debugger is detected, but instead secretly alter the state of an internal variable so that an incorrect OTP is generated at a later point. Make sure to run through the complete workflow to determine if attaching the debugger causes a crash or malfunction.

### Testing Memory Integrity Checks

#### Overview

-- TODO [Provide a general description of the issue "Testing Memory Integrity Checks".] --

#### Static Analysis

-- TODO [Describe how to assess this given either the source code or installer package (APK/IPA/etc.), but without running the app. Tailor this to the general situation (e.g., in some situations, having the decompiled classes is just as good as having the original source, in others it might make a bigger difference). If required, include a subsection about how to test with or without the original sources.] --

-- [Confirm purpose of remark "Use the &lt;sup&gt; tag to reference external sources, e.g. Meyer's recipe for tomato soup<sup>[1]</sup>."] --

##### With Source Code

-- TODO [Add content for static analysis of "Testing Memory Integrity Checks" with source code] --

##### Without Source Code
