## Testing Local Authentication in iOS Apps

Most of the authentication and session management requirements of the MASVS are generic ones, that do not rely on a specific implementation on iOS or Android.

As a result only requirement "4.6	Biometric authentication, if any, is not event-bound (i.e. using an API that simply returns "true" or "false"). Instead, it is based on unlocking the keychain/keystore." is described in this chapter. All other test need to verify server side implementations and can be found in the Appendix "Testing Authentication".


### Testing Biometric Authentication

#### Overview

-- TODO [Provide a general description of the issue "Testing Biometric Authentication".]

#### Static Analysis

-- TODO [Describe how to assess this given either the source code or installer package (APK/IPA/etc.), but without running the app. Tailor this to the general situation (e.g., in some situations, having the decompiled classes is just as good as having the original source, in others it might make a bigger difference). If required, include a subsection about how to test with or without the original sources.] --

-- TODO [Confirm purpose of remark "Use the &lt;sup&gt; tag to reference external sources, e.g. Meyer's recipe for tomato soup<sup>[1]</sup>."] --

-- TODO [Add content for "Testing Biometric Authentication" with source code] --

#### Dynamic Analysis

-- TODO [Describe how to test for this issue "Testing Biometric Authentication" by running and interacting with the app. This can include everything from simply monitoring network traffic or aspects of the appâ€™s behavior to code injection, debugging, instrumentation, etc.] --

#### Remediation

-- TODO [Describe the best practices that developers should follow to prevent this issue "Testing Biometric Authentication".] --
